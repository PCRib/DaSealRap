  <p class="verse1 background">There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
    You became the light on the dark side of me
    Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill</p>

    <h3 class="dave background">But did you know that when it snows
      My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?</h3>

        A light hits the gloom on the grey</p>
